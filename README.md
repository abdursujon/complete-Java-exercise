# complete-Java-exercise

A hands-on Java practice repository covering a-z practical exercises. This repo is not for reading theory but a practical reference for every topic in java.

## Purpose
- Build solid Java fundamentals by raw code
- Understand how Java actually works, not just syntax
- Practice control flow, data types, OOP, and basic algorithms

## A-Z Topic Will be covered few examples are
- Chapter 1: Data types, variables, arrays (primitive vs reference)
- Chapter 2: Operators
- Chapter 3: Control statements (if, switch, loops, nesting)
- Chapter 4: Classes as data types, objects, fields, object interaction
- Chapter 5: Methods, parameters, return values, method overloading, objects as parameters
- Algorithm: Basic algorithms (linear search, iteration logic)
- Chapter 6: Inheritance
- Chapter 7: Packages and interfaces
- Chapter 8: Exception handling
- Chapter 9: Multithreaded programming
- Chapter 10: Enumerations, autoboxing, annotations
- Chapter 17: Data structures
- And Many More 



## Structure
- Each chapter is on it's own package easy to follow and each concept has practical example.
- This repo is structure in a practical way that every time anyone needs an example of certain topic, they can find them in relevant chapter package.
- Code is written for learning, not frameworks
- No shortcuts, no magic, no libraries doing automated testing
- This is pure writing code examples followed and learn through reading the book "Java The Complete Reference" by Herbert Schildt.
